I Created a Drink Water Notification Reminder App in Python
In this tutorial we are going to create a python application which will remind us to drink water periodically. 
This application will track time and show you notification after a brief period of time to remind you to drink water. 
We are going to use plyer  module to show the notification and the time module to run the module after a fixed period of time. You can install plyer by typing “pip install plyer” on the terminal/cmd.

->pytherw.exe main.py #to run in background
